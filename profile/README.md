# The (unofficial) eSafety Guidebook

This group/repositories will not only host tools & resources for digital online safety but will attempt to provide almost a mirror to articles found on the official [eSafety Website](https://www.esafety.gov.au/) with a lot of the fear mongering ripped out.

It is important to note, this is for the most part a solo project. And while I will attempt to avoid bias at the end of the day the resources found here will be [**opinionated**](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/opinionated).

> This group is (for better or for worse) not related in anyway to the official eSafety Commissioner.
